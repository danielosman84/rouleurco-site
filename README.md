## Requirements

## Building for Production

## Formspree Configuration

The contact form uses Formspree. Update the `action` attribute in
`components/HomePage.js` with your Formspree form endpoint:

```jsx
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">
  ...
</form>
```

Replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id` with the URL provided by Formspree.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and processed by
PostCSS. Styles are loaded from `styles/globals.css`.

## Browser Support

Modern browsers are targeted by default. Legacy browsers like IE11 are
excluded to keep the JavaScript output small and avoid unnecessary
polyfills. See `.browserslistrc` for the exact list of supported
browsers.
